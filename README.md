# My New Best Friend

## Description
This app is to help potential adopters find a dog in their area as well as learn about the typical temperaments and age expectancy of the said breed. This app was created with the use of the MiniCSS framework, the Petfinder API, and the Dog as a service API (aka The Dog API).

## User Story

```
As a person interested in adopting a dog,
I want an application that can search adoptable dogs and their breed's related information,
So that I can make a more educated decision when adopting a dog.
